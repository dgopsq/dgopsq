### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm an experienced Software Engineer with a strong knowledge of React / React Native and NodeJS. I've also played with almost every other language out there, including TypeScript, Scala, Rust, and PureScript. Functional programming is my go-to paradigm when possible, and I've had the opportunity to use it extensively in my career.
